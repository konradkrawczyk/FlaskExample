#Backgorund:

This is a very simple example of how to use flask.

#Installation:

pip install flask
pip install flask-cors

Might need to do sudo above, so if you do not have sudo rights, do this instead:

pip install --user flask
pip install --user flask-cors

This should place the flask binary in ~/.local/bin/ or so.

#Running.

Go to backend, where main.py is and run as follows:

FLASK_APP=main.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0

The 0.0.0.0 will assure that it is not running locally but rather globally.

This will start the flask service which will be available via browser.

#Check that API example works

This should produce meaningful output:

http://youd_domain:5000/apiexample?sample_input=bla

above will call the process_api_call() method.

#Check that Website example works

This should produce meaningful output:

http://your_domain:5000/printprettywebsite?sample_input=bla

above will call the process_website_call() method.

#Hybrid Design.

in folder web/ the index file demonstrates how to use flask to fetch data from backend via its api call, process it using javascript and present on the website.
